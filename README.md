# DSND-Seattle-Airbnb

## Description
In this project for the Data Science Nanodegree, I have explored and analysed the Airbnb data of Seattle, in the superhost status and availability rate. As a frequent traveller on Airbnb, I have always wondered whether the superhost status would result in higher revenue (being more fully booked and being able to charge more). I have therefore posed the following questions to explore:

1. Are superhosts' properties more occupied (lower future occupancy) than non-superhosts'? For properties in the same neighbourhood and of similar size, how does availability compare?
2. Are superthosts' properties priced higher than non-superhosts? For properties in the same neighbourhood and of similar size, how does price compare?
3. Other than the superhost status (as a plausible factor), what are the top five factors that affect occupancy (i.e. high future availability)?


## Methodology 
This project follows the CRISP-DM process. Details are narrated in the jupyter notebook and summarised in the blogpost. I will briefly explain the statistical test and model choices in the project.

##### Questions 1 & 2.
